For this reason, there are packages that allow you to buy a ticket with full access to a large number of attractions in the city with the aim of maximizing a person's time during their visiting days. Currently, there is currently a lot of offer in this type of tourist access passes in the city.\n\n### For this reason, the studio consists of creating a package that includes the 30 best attractions in the city and at the best possible price. Various variables that lead to definitively determining the 30 attractions will be analyzed. However, since we work for Air BnB, the main and most important objective of the study is to determine the best 20 neighborhoods for Air BnB clients so that they can stay during their visit having the closest proximity and accessibility to tourist places to maximize the time of your visit. It will be calculated what is the price that these neighborhoods must have to host and provide the tourist client with the best experience in New York City."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data explanation"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### I will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City. You will use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. You will use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, you will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters.\n\n### I will also use the csv file with neighborhoods data provided in previous labs in order. I'm going to run diferent Regression algorithms with emphasis in multiple linear regression to calculate de estimated price for  the package of 30 attractions considering variables such as food options around, tips, price of attraction, accesible location, and many others. \n\n###  I will use clustering methods to determine the list of 20 neighborhoods considering the previous analysis. Also, to calculete the estimated price for the neighborhoods I will run again a multiple linear regression algorithm considering the 20 attractions variables and their relation with the neighborhoods near them.
